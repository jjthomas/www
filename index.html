I am currently a fifth-year Computer Science PhD student at Stanford working with Professors <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~matei/">Matei Zaharia</a> and <a href="https://graphics.stanford.edu/~hanrahan/">Pat Hanrahan</a> on simplifying hardware design.
I received S.B. and M.Eng. degrees in EECS from MIT in June 2016. <br /><br />

<h3> Research Papers</h3>
<ol>
<li>My PhD research has been focused on productive but still performant hardware development flows for datacenter applications. <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~matei/papers/2020/asplos_fleet.pdf">Here</a> is a paper on this work that appeared at ASPLOS 2020.</li>
<li>Starting during my M.Eng., I worked on Weld, an intermediate language for data parallel computations that targets vector units, multicores, and GPU's. <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~matei/papers/2017/cidr_weld.pdf">Here</a> is a short paper on our work that appeared at CIDR 2017. <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~matei/papers/2018/vldb_weld.pdf">Here</a> is a longer paper in VLDB 2018.</li>
<li>As part of the SuperUROP undergraduate research program at MIT, I worked on a graph-parallel computation framework designed to run physical simulations on locally connected 3D mesh graphs. A paper on this work can be found <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3210395">here</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Internship Presentations</h3>
<ol>
<li>At Microsoft Research in the summer of 2015, I worked on a library for incremental computation on top of Apache Spark. My end-of-internship presentation can be found <a href="msr-intern.pdf">here</a>.</li>
<li>At Cloudera in the summer of 2014, I worked on a number of improvements to the open-source Hadoop Distributed Filesystem (HDFS). A presentation I gave on my work can be found <a href="cloudera-intern.pdf">here</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Class Reports</h3>
<ol>
<li>For the final project of 6.111 (Digital Circuits) in fall 2014, my team built a system for automatic correction of the input to a projector based on the projector's angles of tilt so that the output would not appear distorted. This project was recognized as one of the best in the course at the <a href="https://www.eecs.mit.edu/news-events/media/eecs-celebrates-its-2015-award-winners">annual EECS awards ceremony</a>. The project writeup can be found <a href="6111_proj_report.pdf">here</a>.</li>
