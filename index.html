I am currently an M. Eng. student at MIT working with <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/matei/">Professor Matei Zaharia</a> in the <a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/">PDOS</a> group at CSAIL.
I am also a member of the MIT undergraduate class of 2016, and hope to receive my bachelor's and master's degrees together in June 2016. <br /><br />

<h3> Research Reports and Presentations</h3>
<ol>
<li>For my M. Eng., I have been working on NVL, an intermediate language for data parallel computations that targets vector units, multicores, and GPU's to achieve machine-level performance. <a href="nvl-poster.pdf">Here</a> is a poster describing our work so far. It was presented at the BigData@CSAIL poster session on 11/5/2015.</li>
<li>As part of the <a href="https://www.eecs.mit.edu/academics-admissions/undergraduate-programs/eecs-super-urop/">SuperUROP</a> undergraduate research program at MIT, which I completed in the <a href="http://supertech.mit.edu/">Supertech</a> group, and the spring 2015 research course 6.886, I worked on a graph-parallel computation framework designed to run physical simulations on locally connected 3D mesh graphs. A paper on this work, which is still ongoing, can be found <a href="laika.pdf">here</a>.</li>
<li>During the first half of the SuperUROP program, I worked on a tool for low-overhead collection of work and critical path length statistics from Cilk programs. A poster on this work that I presented at a SuperUROP poster session in fall 2014 can be found <a href="superurop-poster.pdf">here</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Internship Presentations</h3>
<ol>
<li>At Microsoft Research in the summer of 2015, I worked on a library for incremental computation on top of Apache Spark. My end-of-internship presentation can be found <a href="msr-intern.pdf">here</a>.</li>
<li>At Cloudera in the summer of 2014, I worked on a number of improvements to the open-source Hadoop Distributed Filesystem (HDFS). A presentation I gave on my work can be found <a href="cloudera-intern.pdf">here</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Class Reports</h3>
<ol>
<li>For the final project of <a href="http://web.mit.edu/6.111/www/f2014/index.html">6.111</a> (Digital Circuits) in fall 2014, my team built a system for automatic correction of the input to a projector based on the projector's angles of tilt so that the output would not appear distorted. This project was recognized as one of the best in the course at the <a href="https://www.eecs.mit.edu/news-events/media/eecs-celebrates-its-2015-award-winners">annual EECS awards ceremony</a>. The project writeup can be found <a href="6111_proj_report.pdf">here</a>.</li>
<li>For the final project of <a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/">6.824</a> (Distributed Systems) in spring 2014, my team added support for transactions to the key-value store we had built in previous labs. Our design was based on <a href="http://hyperdex.org/warp/">HyperDex</a>. The final paper can be found <a href="6824_proj_report.pdf">here</a>.</li>
